          I was born in a small city in Egypt called Al-Mansoura in 2000, from a
          young age I was always fascinated with technology, tweaking and
          playing with them.
          <br />
          <br /> On a late night when I was 14, I was simply browsing the
          internet when I got the curiousity about how websites are made and
          that&apos;s the night that decided what my career will be.
          <br />
          <br /> I started developing my skills as time progressed, getting into
          JavaScript, React and everything to do with the development flow of
          web applications.
          <br />
          <br /> I also developed skills on the backend with GraphQL and REST,
          but I hated how ugly my projects looked and thatâ€™s when I also started
          studying design.
          <br />
          <br /> Over the years, I grew a passion for building WYSIWYG editors,
          design systems and monorepos, mostly in React projects. I became very
          skilled in those areas and I keep improving every day!
